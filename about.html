       <h2> Who is Jayden?</h2>
       I'm an 18 year old Freshman at Borough of Manhattan Community College. I enjoy baking sweet treats like; cookies, cakes, etc., playing guitar (which I have been for almost a year), and playing video games. I've been using Adobe software like Illustrator and Photoshop for more than 3 years. I'm a very creative person so I enjoy the process of turning and idea I have into a piece of media like a poster, animation, and/or drawing. I strive to become a succesful UX Designer/Graphic Designer to help those who cannot bring their brilliant ideas to life.
